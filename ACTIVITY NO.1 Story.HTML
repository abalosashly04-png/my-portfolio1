    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>
        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between 
        the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals 
        her work appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of <i>On The Road</i>. It had been Molly's favorite 
        book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>

    <p>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde 
        quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> 
        Although many considered her pioneering work—unraveling the secrets of the llama 
        <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr>—to be an outstanding achievement, 
        Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
    </p>
